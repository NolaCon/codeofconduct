# NolaCon Code of Conduct
 
### Importance
We firmly believe in the value and importance of an environment where all event participants feel welcomed and safe. This Code of Conduct explains what type of behavior we expect from event participants. The terms of this Code of Conduct are non-negotiable. We will not tolerate behavior that runs counter to this Code of Conduct.

### Behavior

1. You will not engage in disruptive speech or behavior or otherwise interfere with the event or other individualsâ€™ participation in the event.
1. You will not engage in any form of harassing, offensive, discriminatory, or threatening speech or behavior, including (but not limited to) relating to race, gender, religion, disability, marital status, age, sexual orientation, or protected veteran status.

If we believe that you are not complying with this Code of Conduct, we may deny you entry or require you leave all event venue(s) (unless otherwise prohibited by law).
